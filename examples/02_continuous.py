monitor a channel (continuous-conversion mode)

In continuous-conversion mode, the ADC automatically begins a conversion of
the input signal as soon as the previous conversion is completed. The rate
of continuous conversion is equal to the programmed data rate. Data can be
read at any time and always reflect the most recent completed conversion.

The ADS1x14 and ADS1x15 feature a programmable digital comparator that can
issue an alert on the ALERT/RDY pin if the low or high threshold values are
exceeded. Together with continuous-conversion mode this feature can be used
to trigger a hardware interrupt and alert on abnormal conditions.

This example works with all variations:
 - ADS1013, ADS1014, ADS1015
 - ADS1113, ADS1114, ADS1115
(Please note that the samping rates on ADS101x and 111x are different.)
